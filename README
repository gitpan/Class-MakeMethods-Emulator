NAME
    Class::MakeMethods::Emulator - Demonstrate class-generator equivalency

SYNOPSIS
      # Equivalent to use Class::Singleton;
      use Class::MakeMethods::Emulator::Singleton; 
  
      # Equivalent to use Class::Struct;
      use Class::MakeMethods::Emulator::Struct; 
      struct ( ... );
  
      # Equivalent to use Class::MethodMaker( ... );
      use Class::MakeMethods::Emulator::MethodMaker( ... );
  
      # Equivalent to use base 'Class::Inheritable';
      use base 'Class::MakeMethods::Emulator::Inheritable';
      MyClass->mk_classdata( ... );
  
      # Equivalent to use base 'Class::AccessorFast';
      use base 'Class::MakeMethods::Emulator::AccessorFast';
      MyClass->mk_accessors(qw(this that whatever));

DESCRIPTION
    In several cases, Class::MakeMethods provides functionality closely
    equivalent to that of an existing module, and it is simple to map the
    existing module's interface to that of Class::MakeMethods.

    Class::MakeMethods::Emulator provides emulators for Class::MethodMaker,
    Class::Accessor::Fast, Class::Data::Inheritable, Class::Singleton, and
    Class::Struct, each of which passes the original module's test suite,
    usually requiring only a single-line change.

    More than demonstrating compatibility, these emulators also generally
    demonstrate the procedure for migrating to direct use of
    Class::MakeMethods.

    interface:
